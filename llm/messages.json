(A)      When  Silvia  Ring  received  the  telephone  summons  to  Antonio  Mosquera\u2019s  office  on  Friday  afternoon, May 31, 1996, she could feel her anxiety level rise.  Only a year earlier, Mosquera had been  appointed  managing  director  of  Merck  Sharp  &  Dohme  Argentina,  Inc.  (MSD),  the  regional  subsidiary of the U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., Inc.  He arrived with a mandate to  remake the insular subsidiary into a dynamic, modern business organization.  An integral part of his  plan  was  to  change  the  company\u2019s  culture  and  professionalize  the  organization.    For  the  previous  eleven  months,  Ring  had  been  in  charge  of  training  and  development  at  MSD  and  was  the  person  directly responsible for implementing much of Mosquera\u2019s program.  Just when it seemed that a new  culture finally was taking hold, however, a sticky situation presented itself.   Friday was the day Ring had been scheduled to announce the names of the fifteen college students  chosen to participate in MSD\u2019s highly selective young professionals intern program.  Over a period of  two weeks, thirty students had been vying for the fifteen coveted spots.  Two days earlier she had  received a phone call from a middle manager who informed her that one of the candidates was the  son  of  a  high-ranking  official  in  the  government\u2019s  national  health  care  program  for  government  retirees,  the  single  largest  health  care  organization  in  the  country.    The  student\u2019s  presence  in  the  company workforce, the caller bluntly stated, would afford MSD an excellent opportunity to increase  sales by insuring that all its drugs were included in the government health care formulary.  Business  in  Argentina  had  long  been  conducted  through  a  web  of  personal  connections  and  any  company  would  envy  MSD  for  its  unexpected  advantage.    Of  the  thirty  candidates,  however,  this  particular  individual  was  ranked  number  sixteen  on  Ring\u2019s  list,  just  below  the  cut.    When  she  explained  the  situation, the caller grew agitated with Ring\u2019s information and threatened to go above her head to  get his way.     When Friday morning arrived, Ring was unsure how to proceed.  Fearful that she would make a  serious  misstep  by  not  accepting  the  young  man  into  the  program,  she  called  Mosquera  from  the  public auditorium where the program was being held to discuss her dilemma.  Mosquera gave Ring  no explicit guidance at first, but said he would get back to her.  Mosquera had not previously been  aware  of  the  candidate  and  assumed  he  would  not  be  barred  from  the  internship  program  under  Merck\u2019s conflict of interest policy.     After  speaking  with  Mosquera,  Ring  decided  to  postpone  her  announcement  of  the  winning  candidates.    When  the  afternoon\u2019s  activities  were  finished,  she  returned  to  her  office  at  MSD  and  immediately received the phone call asking her to come to Mosquera\u2019s office.

(A)   the corridor, she experienced a wave of self-doubt.  Maybe this is the great mistake, she thought.   When she entered the managing director\u2019s office, she was surprised.  Already seated were Cristina  Quinteiro, the director of human resources, and Martin Rodriguez Hunter, the director of sales.  With  his  usual  informality,  Mosquera  leaned  against  his  desk  and  came  quickly  to  the  point.    After  explaining the situation, he said simply, Okay we have this issue, and we have to make a decision.   He wanted each of the three in turn to make a recommendation and explain it before the group.   Argentine Setting   Company history Merck\u2019s roots in Argentina dated back to 1915, when it authorized the H.K.  Mulford  Company  to  be  the  local  distributor  for  its  pharmaceutical  products.    The  business  relationship continued until 1954 when Merck & Co. itself entered Argentina.  Four years later Merck  merged with Sharp & Dohme, which had first opened an office in Argentina in 1936, to form MSD.   From  its  headquarters  in  Buenos  Aires,  MSD  covered  the  three-country  region  of  Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay.  Merck imported all pharmaceutical products until 1979, when it opened a  manufacturing facility in Pilar, Argentina.     Unlike many multinational companies, MSD did not exit the country during the severe economic  turmoil of the 1980s, when raging hyper-inflation made price-setting impossible to control from afar.   Instead, it signed a licensing and distribution agreement in 1988 with Instituto Sidus, an Argentine  pharmaceutical company.  Sidus purchased MSD\u2019s manufacturing facility in Pilar and under terms of  the  transaction,  which  ran  until  the  year  2000,  had  exclusive  rights  to  produce  and  distribute  products that were marketed by MSD in Argentina and Paraguay at the time of the agreement.  Sidus  also had the right of first refusal for licenses of new products developed by Merck and introduced  after 1988.     By  the  mid-1990s,  as  a  result  of  the  agreement,  Merck  still  maintained  a  strong  position  in  Argentina\u2019s  roughly  $2.8  billion  pharmaceutical  market.    Sales  were  divided  into  three  categories:  Group I for those promoted and distributed by Sidus under license from Merck; Group II for those  distributed by Sidus and promoted by MSD; and Group III for those promoted and distributed by  MSD.  Group III products were those that Merck had licensed-in and Sidus had elected not to license.   The  combined  sales  volume  of  all  its  products  placed  Merck  consistently  among  the  top-tier  pharmaceutical firms in Argentina.  (See Exhibit 1.)     Cultural context Mosquera took charge of MSD at a critical juncture in Argentina\u2019s history.  For  at  least  fifty  years,  Argentina,  like  most  of  its  Latin  American  neighbors,  functioned  under  a  nationalist  economy.    High  protective  tariffs  kept  out  imports,  and  domestic  business  activity  was  directed by the policies of the highly authoritarian state.  The high inflation that accompanied such  policies became a permanent feature of Argentine life.  In an economic milieu that was uncompetitive  and grossly inefficient, Argentine companies became stagnant, bureaucratic, and rife with cronyism.   When Carlos Menem was elected president in 1989, Argentina\u2019s annual inflation rate was over 3000%  and the economy had ground to a near standstill.      A  series  of  drastic  reforms  introduced  by  Menem  in  the  early  1990s  reversed  a  half  century  of  economic  policies  and  opened  the  country  to  trade  and  competition.    The  cornerstone  of  Menem\u2019s  economic program was a monetary reform measure that pegged the Argentine currency to the U.S.  dollar  and  brought  an  immediate  halt  to  spiraling  inflation.    That,  in  turn,  set  in  motion  a  strong  economic  expansion,  as  GDP  grew  from  0.1%  in  1990  to  8.7%  in  1992  to  7.4%  in  1994.1    With  low                                                              1 Economist Intelligence Unit, quarterly reports.   2   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   398-033   inflation and robust economic growth a reality by the mid-1990s, Argentine companies faced a crucial  need to modernize business practices and a business culture that had been formed under decades of  an uncompetitive, closed economy.   New Managing Director   Background When  he  arrived  in  Argentina,  Mosquera  had  been  employed  with  Merck  in  various  capacities  for  nearly  two  decades.    He  first  joined  the  company  in  1976  as  an  information  systems manager in Spain, his home country.  In the intervening years, he had served as a financial  controller, sales representative, product manager, and sales director in Spain, England, and the USA- Canada.    He  was  executive  director  for  New  Business  Latin  America  at  Merck  headquarters  in  Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, when he was asked to take over the post of managing director for  MSD  Argentina.    Merck  felt  that  the  new  business  environment  in  Argentina  warranted  a  more  competitive presence there and sought to bring its subsidiary up to the same standards expected in  other  countries.    Though  the  company  was  not  in  a  financial  crisis,  sales  remained  flat,  and  competition was intensifying as foreign manufacturers began to re-enter the Argentine market.   Mosquera accepted the offer and in March 1995, at age 47, he arrived in Buenos Aires with a  5-year planning horizon.  After an orientation under the outgoing director, he officially assumed his  new duties in May.  By chance, his arrival coincided with the onset of a severe recession caused by  the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994.    Analysis  of  MSD During  his  first  two  months\u2019  on  the  job,  Mosquera  conducted  his  own  analysis  of  the  company  and  concluded  that  MSD\u2019s  culture  and  management  structure  had  to  be  thoroughly transformed.  Although he had dealt with the subsidiary in his former position in New  Jersey, he said he didn\u2019t realize how much change was needed until I arrived here.  He noted that  MSD shared many of the same characteristics that plagued other Argentine businesses.  Management  operated  according  to  a  rigid  hierarchy,  with  all  important  decision-making  in  the  hands  of  the  managing director and three or four department directors.  Within the pyramid-shaped organization,  functions  were  maintained  separately  and  relationships  were  structured  vertically.    Departments  conducted  business  largely  oblivious  of  one  another,  with  little  sharing  of  information  or  cross- coordination even for product promotion.  Employees did only what they were told; innovation and  personal  initiative  were  discouraged.    Advancement  was  based on  personal  relationships  nurtured  over many years, which meant that powerful cliques dominated the organization.     Many  managers  lacked  professional  education.  Their  knowledge  of  the  pharmaceutical  market  was  based  on  street  smarts  mastered  through  years  of  experience  in  an  industry  that  operated largely by routine.  Almost all had worked their way up from the sales force, the mainstay  of  the  organization.    Of  about  175  employees  at  MSD  in  May  1995,  half  were  sales  representatives  who belonged to a tightly controlled union.  In every province of Argentina except the federal city of  Buenos Aires, sales reps were legally required to have a license that could be obtained only through  completing two years of a union-run program.  Admission to the program was generally confined to  friends and relatives of members.  Few reps held a college degree, and they were disdainful of the  younger  workers  who  did.    Consequently,  being  a  sales  rep  was  nothing  a  professional  could  be  proud of, said one MSD executive.  That was why Argentine companies couldn\u2019t attract physicians  or other professionals to work in their sales departments, as was common in other countries.    Restructuring plan Mosquera knew that time was of the essence.  As quickly as possible he set  out to transform the organization.  He gave himself one year to rebuild the top management team  and get the right people in the right place.  Only after that task was completed could the organization   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  3   398-033   Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   focus on where it was going on a long-term basis.  Changing the culture he knew would take much  longer\u2014a minimum of three years, he expected.   From  the  outset,  Mosquera  was  guided  by  three  inter-related  goals\u2014a  flatter,  more  integrated  management  structure  (no  silos),  complete  transparency,  and  empowerment\u2014that  became  the  mantra  for  his  vision  of  the  future  organization.    The  old  hierarchical  structure,  with  only  four  directors reporting to the managing director, was scrapped and a new structure with 12 directors was  introduced  in  July  1995  (see  Exhibit  2).    Borrowing  an  idea  advanced  by  Merck\u2019s  new  CEO,  Ray  Gilmartin, he decided to break down silos, the term used to describe parallel functions like sales,  marketing, finance, and research, which were hierarchically organized and independently managed.   Rather than segmenting different functions, Mosquera reorganized the company into business units  around  key  product  lines  and  related  activities.    Each  unit  was  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  multiple tasks that previously had been performed independently by the silos.     The  restructuring  plan  transformed  the  company\u2019s  power  structure.    The  slot  for  marketing  director was eliminated altogether, for instance, and the prominence given the role of sales director  was much reduced.  The move represented a major change, for the sales and marketing directors had  long been considered the second and third most important positions in the company, right below the  level of managing director, with responsibility for all the company\u2019s product lines.   The  business  unit  strategy  eliminated  a  layer  of  bureaucracy  and  gave  managers  significantly  more  authority  to  take  quick,  decisive  action.    Under  the  old  system,  the  levels  of  hierarchy  comprised  sales  director,  regional  manager,  district  manager,  and  sales  reps.    The  new  structure  folded the position of regional manager into that of district manager.  The head of each business unit  was a commercial manager, a position that required knowledge and talent in many different areas.      In Mosquera\u2019s estimation, managers in the old system were really nothing more than supervisors.   The marketing director would issue the sales department a plan, and sales managers would simply  follow  the  same  routine  implementation  year  after  year  without  ever  making  a  decision  of  any  consequence.  Mosquera made it clear that he now demanded managers who made decisions and were  willing  to  be  held  accountable,  not  passive  supervisors  and  not  functional  specialists.    Business  unit  managers were expected to make informed decisions by incorporating information supplied by sales  reps in the field with information from other sources, like marketing and Merck headquarters.     Mosquera  realized  that  what  he  was  asking  was  difficult.    He  warned  new  managers,  Being  a  manager is not easy.  It is not just having a nice car, a nice paycheck.  It is a lot of problems\u2026.Some of  you won\u2019t be able to do this.  At the same time, he promised help to all who wanted it.   Mosquera simultaneously set out to change other aspects of MSD.  A major project was to educate  both  old  and  new  employees  in  the  more  open  system  he  desired  for  the  company,  a  culture  that  encouraged  information  sharing,  personal  initiative,  and  non-authoritarian  decision-making.   Employees were to express opinions freely and to question established practices whenever they had a  better  solution  to  offer.    He  wanted  an  organization  of  professionals  all  through  the  ranks  who  willingly embraced responsibility for their actions.    To encourage the new mentality, he established a special unit, independent of human resources,  devoted solely to training and development.  The new unit was integral to the company\u2019s strategy,  for Mosquera saw training\u2014learning about things\u2014and development\u2014growth as an individual  and a professional\u2014as critical to the organization\u2019s success.  Every person, from the receptionist on  up, would be expected to have a plan for their development, including both personal and business  goals.    Beginning  in  January  1996  and  continuing  through  the  year,  all  sales  managers  were   4   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   398-033   scheduled to undergo 200 hours of mandatory training activities that were intended to coach them in  the new values and expected behavior.     Mosquera  actively  promoted  transparency,  which  he  described  as  no  secrets,  full  disclosure,  and good communication throughout the organization to every employee.  Job vacancies with a full  description of the requirements were posted for everyone\u2019s benefit and were open to anyone who felt  qualified to apply.  Under the old system, job openings were never posted; they were parceled out as  favors  through  the  web  of  personal  connections.    Mosquera  also  emphasized  the  need  for  honest  dialogue and told his managers that they wouldn\u2019t be fired for admitting they didn\u2019t know how to  do something, that they needed to work on certain skills.     The changes Mosquera instituted proved to be traumatic for many managers.  Schooled to run the  organization according to a strict regimen, to brook no dissent, and to defer all decisions to a few top  authorities, they were now being told to reverse direction and actively encourage independent, open  questioning\u2014behavior that in the past had been treated as insubordination.  They were being told to  practice consensus decision-making at all levels.  To create a sense of urgency, Mosquera frequently  challenged the management team, asking, Who is with me and who is against me? and Are you  supervisors or are you managers?     Some long-time managers could not accept the new atmosphere and departed for pharmaceutical  companies  that  operated  in  the  traditional  manner.    Mosquera  indicated  that  about  10  left  in  that  fashion.  Other employees had to be let go.  The two most difficult decisions involved the departure  in late 1995 of the sales and the marketing directors, both old MSD employees and the most powerful  figures  in  the  company  aside  from  the  managing  director.    But,  as  Mosquera  lamented,  they  just  couldn\u2019t accept the adjustment and had to leave.       Emphasis on ethics Ethical behavior was an obsession with him, Mosquera explained, and  he intended to make it the foundation of the new culture at MSD.  He credited his father, the most  honest  guy  I  ever  met,  with  instilling  in  him  a  heightened  awareness  for  the  importance  of  right  action.  In the pharmaceutical industry, among the more common forms of corruption was incentives  paid to physicians for prescribing certain products.  The policy he adopted at MSD was not to pay  incentives, but to rely instead on convincing customers to choose Merck products because they were  the best remedies on the market and, overall, the best for the patient.     Promoting  ethics  was  especially  important  in  Argentina,  Mosquera  emphasized,  because  corruption was a significant issue in the society.  Within days of his arrival, he had been stopped for a  minor traffic violation and was given the choice of paying a hefty bribe to the police officer on the  spot  or  receiving  a  citation.    Mosquera  chose  the  citation  and  quickly  became  active  in  the  Public  Ethics Foundation, a group of businessmen and other concerned citizens eager to reduce the level of  corruption in the country.  If we want to be successful as an organization, Mosquera stated, we  have to help change the environment.  We can\u2019t wait for the environment to change itself.   Ethical  standards,  moreover,  had  particular  relevance  for  multinational  pharmaceutical  companies  because  of  the  serious  problem  they  all  faced  in  Argentina.    Patent  protection  for  pharmaceutical  products  did  not  exist,  so  drug  copying  was  a  flourishing  national  industry.   Argentine pharmaceutical companies enjoyed enormous political clout and regularly stymied efforts  by the multinational drug manufacturers and their governments to change the law.  The county\u2019s two  largest pharmaceutical firms were national companies whose profits came entirely from copies.     To communicate the ethics message, Mosquera initiated the development of a mission and values  statement (see Exhibit 3) that all employees could access easily on their computers.  He had the legal  affairs  department,  another  of  the  new  business  units  he  formed,  conduct  seminars  on  ethics  that   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  5   398-033   Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   everyone  was  required  to  attend.    Most  conspicuously,  he  tried  to  set  the  example  in  day-to-day  activity and he exhorted all managers to do likewise.     One  year  later As  he  passed  his  first  year  at  MSD,  Mosquera  could  point  to  a  number  of  accomplishments.    The  management  restructuring  was  successful,  though  it  took  much  longer  to  complete than he had anticipated.  The last major management slot wasn\u2019t filled until March, but he  attributed the delay to care in selecting the personnel: I was very particular about who I hired.  He  took the unusual step of picking some managers from outside the pharmaceutical industry, a glaring  deviation  from  long  established  protocol.    If  a  drug  company  wanted  to  hire  a  new  manager,  the  standard  procedure  was  to  pick  someone  in  that  specific  department  from  another  pharmaceutical  company.    Mosquera,  however,  had  made  it  clear  all  along  that  he  was  looking  for  more  than  experience.  He wanted people who were decisive yet flexible, receptive to new ideas, and exhibited  good leadership skills.  He pointed out another stipulation: When I interviewed new employees, I  talked about the company\u2019s position on ethics to make sure they agreed with it.     A year after he took over the company, almost a quarter of the employees were new to MSD.  The  size of the workforce had increased from about 175 to over 200, and included a number of turnovers.   Information flowed more freely throughout the organization, although problems still surfaced from  time to time.  On one occasion, for instance, Mosquera learned that a high potential manager told  his  employees  not  to  say  anything  bad  to  a  task  force  sent  from  headquarters.    Mosquera  had  warned  the  manager  earlier  against  preventing  employees  from  speaking  candidly  with  company  officials.  It was precisely the type of behavior that was expected in the past, but now was antithetical  to the open culture Mosquera demanded.  He had the wrong attitude, Mosquera said, so I had to  fire him to send a message to the rest of the management staff.     Overall, he claimed, employees began to respond positively to his efforts to change the culture.   Many  employees  said  they  found  Mosquera  a  genuinely  accessible  person  who  practiced  what  he  preached  by  listening  to  their  concerns  and  suggestions.    He  constantly  showed  his  face  to  all  employees, one junior manager recalled, which no director of any kind had ever done before.     Mosquera himself had found the Argentine environment somewhat unsettling in comparison to  Europe and the United States.  Here, you receive a surprise every fifteen minutes, he said.  One  day  everything  seems  normal  and  the  next  day  someone  reports  that  Argentina  has  a  22%  unemployment  rate.    Of  course,  Argentina\u2019s  unemployment  rate  doesn\u2019t  change  overnight,  but  no  one  here  has  reliable  information.      In  the  face  of  such  uncertainty,  along  with  corruption,  drug  copying, and ethics problems, Mosquera had asked himself more than once how he could possibly  develop a five-year plan and get everyone in the company moving forward in a single direction.   Nevertheless, he had set ambitious objectives for 1996.  In consultation with his boss at Merck\u2019s  annual goal-setting process, he was aiming for 26% growth in sales coupled with only 16% growth in  operating  expenses.    In  addition,  he  had  set  specific  goals  for  new  product  introductions,  cultural  change,  strategic  planning,  recruiting,  and  addressing  the  intellectual  property  protection  and  corruption  issues  in  Argentina.    Mosquera\u2019s  performance  for  the  year  would  be  evaluated  against  both his quantitative and qualitative objectives.        Human Resources Director   When  Cristina  Quinteiro  first  interviewed  for  the  position  of  human  resources  director  in  May  1995, she knew nothing about the company or the pharmaceutical industry.  She had a law degree  from  Buenos  Aires  University and  had  spent  her  career  as  a  human  resources  manager for  a  large   6   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.

As  part  of  her  work  for the  industrial  concern,  she was  sent  to  Japan  to  study that country\u2019s unique work methods and came away from the experience a firm believer in the  work-team concept.  She found the process of working in cross-functional teams and not in silos an  enlightened  alternative  the  authority-based  management  of  Argentinean  companies.   Consequently,  she  was  very  receptive  to  Mosquera\u2019s  plans  for  MSD.  She  looked  forward  to  the  challenge  of  changing  the  general  attitude  of  employees  and  creating  a  new  culture  centered  on  empowerment, transparency, and a flatter hierarchy.   to   What  especially  attracted  her  to  MSD,  however,  was  Mosquera\u2019s  emphasis  on  ethics.    It  was  a  theme particularly critical for a pharmaceutical company, she said, because we were responsible for  the health care of people.   Moreover, she added, it was sorely needed to counter the high levels of  corruption  in  Argentina,  which  over  the  years  had  become  an  accepted  part  of  everyday  life.   Argentine pharmaceutical companies were all unethical in her judgment because they copied drugs  and used improper marketing practices.    In July she became the human resources director and the first outside manager Mosquera hired.   He  was  deliberately  looking  for  a  human  resources  director  from  outside  the  industry,  she  explained,  because  he  wanted  someone  with  a  different  perspective,  who  understood  what  he  wanted to achieve and what type employees he needed for the task.  The act immediately caught the  attention of the pharmaceutical industry, for it represented a sharp break with the habits and customs  of  drug  companies  in  Argentina.    Quinteiro  was a female in an industry  that  had  very few  female  managers and none as senior managers, and she was an outsider in an industry that was renowned  for  hiring  only  from  within  its  ranks.    In  fact,  she  was  the  first  human  resources  director  of  a  pharmaceutical company in Argentina who came from outside the industry.     Quinteiro had two priorities as human resource director: to hire a large number of new employees  and  to  assist  Mosquera\u2019s  efforts  to  transform  the  culture.    Restructuring  had  greatly  expanded  the  company,  and  filling  the  new  positions  with  the  right  people  required  diligence  and  care.    The  pharmaceutical industry in Argentina was very predictable Quinteiro said, and Mosquera wanted  a staff that was ready to strike out in new directions.  Antonio wanted new blood, she explained.   In some cases we preferred to hire professionals from outside the pharmaceutical industry because  in Argentina those who work in the industry have a very limited view about how markets work.     In selecting new employees she looked for the qualities laid out by Mosquera: personal initiative;  leadership;  ability  to  adapt  to  changing  circumstances;  problem-solving  skills;  oriented  toward  a  continuous  learning  process.    Aside  from  the  desire  to  introduce  new  blood  into  the  company,  Quinteiro  was  forced  to  hire  outsiders  for  leadership  positions  because  few  employees  within  the  company possessed the skills and knowledge to operate under a business unit concept.  Mosquera  estimated that it would take a year of training to prepare existing employees for the new structure.    Beginning in August 1995, Quinteiro worked with Mosquera in supervising the development of  the  mission  and  values  statement.    Mosquera  very  much  wanted  the  final  document  to  be  an  expression of all MSD employees.  Using the Merck corporate statement of mission and values as a  reference point, the MSD executive committee convened in August to identify the gaps between the  ideals  they  espoused  and  the  reality  they  lived.    A  draft  was  developed  and  sent  for  review  by  managers in October and other employees in November.  The feedback from each gap analysis led  to revisions of the document.  By December, Mosquera and the executive committee were able to sign  off on a final statement.     In  January,  the  MSD  top  management  team  participated  in  a  360-degree  evaluation  process.   Each  manager  was  evaluated  by  peers,  subordinates,  bosses,  and  customers  against  the  values,  attitudes, and behaviors articulated in the mission and values statement.  Managers also evaluated   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  7   398-033   Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   themselves.  (See Exhibit 4 for sample questions.)  Three months later, line managers went through a  similar  360-degree  process,  followed  by  coaching  and  counseling  in  areas  needing  improvement.   Quinteiro was also working on a new performance appraisal system that linked back to the espoused  values.  (See Exhibit 5.)  Trying to do all these changes was very difficult, Quinteiro emphasized.   We had to work very hard with the employees.  But a year later this was beginning to look like a  very different company from when I started.    Intern  program The  young  professionals  intern  program  was  developed  by  Mosquera  and  Quinteiro  as  a  tool  to  groom  people  in  their  final  year  of  college  for  a  possible  career  with  the  company.    MSD  inaugurated  the  program  in  the  spring  of  1996.    It  advertised  the  internships  at  college  campuses  in  Argentina,  but  enlisted  an  outside  consulting  firm  to  handle  the  actual  recruiting.    The  consulting  company  sifted  through  over  1,200  applicants  and  chose  about  70  for  personal  interviews  and  a  battery  of  psychological  and  problem-solving  tests.    Thirty  of  those  candidates  were  selected  to  participate  in  a  two-week  program  overseen  by  MSD\u2019s  director  of  development and training, Silvia Ring, who would test their skills in a variety of interactive exercises.     The  candidates  were  judged  on  a  point  system  and  the  total  points  each  candidate  garnered  determined the final rankings.  The selection process was carefully spelled out to all the candidates.   The fifteen chosen for the internships would be assigned to assist sales representatives for on-the-job  training  experience.    They  would  work  about  20  hours  a  week,  usually  in  the  late  afternoons,  and  were employed for a period of six months.  At its discretion, MSD might extend the internship for  another  3-6  months.    When  the  students  graduated  from  college,  the  company  would  offer  employment to those interns found most promising.  The internships carried a very good stipend and  for all participants, Quinteiro said, it was a valuable experience to put on their resumes.     Decision Quinteiro  was  unaware  of  any  problem  surrounding  the  selection  of  candidates  for  the  intern  program  when  she  was  called  to  the  meeting  in  Mosquera\u2019s  office.    After  everyone  had  gathered, Mosquera explained the situation and asked Quinteiro for her opinion of the matter first.   I really don\u2019t think we should hire this guy, she began.  There were fifteen who were judged better  than him, so it is not fair to include this person and exclude one of the others.  It is very important to  do what we said we were going to do.   Director of Sales   When he joined the company as the sales director in November 1995, Martin Rodriguez Hunter  was the second outside manager hired by Mosquera.  He brought to Merck 15 years\u2019 experience in  sales, marketing, and finance in a variety of industries, the previous four spent locally with another  U.S.-based pharmaceutical company.  During interviews for the position, he was struck at once by  Mosquera\u2019s approach to management.  Mosquera spoke enthusiastically about his plans for flattening  the  hierarchy,  integrating  sales  with  other  functions  like  marketing,  and  empowering  lower  level  managers  with  responsibility  for  decision-making.    All  of  those  features  were  decidedly  uncharacteristic of Argentine companies, especially in the pharmaceutical industry.  Antonio had a  clear vision of what he wanted to do, Rodriguez Hunter said, and Mosquera\u2019s plan gave life to ideas  he had held privately for years.  It felt like I finally was talking to somebody who spoke the same  language, Rodriguez Hunter explained.       Resistance to change, said Rodriguez Hunter, had long been characteristic of the pharmaceutical  business in Argentina and he had become very frustrated.  He cited two personal examples that he  said typified the reigning mentality in the industry.  In one company where he worked, he tried to  offer his boss some simple advice for improving sales, but his boss put a stop to all future efforts with   8   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   398-033   a  terse  admonition:  I  think  it\u2019s  great  you  think  that  way,  but  we\u2019ll  do  it  my  way.    On  another  occasion he mentioned to the controller of the company a different way of conducting business that  could vastly increase profits, and the manager responded: For the last 25 years I have submitted the  profits that the company had asked of me, so why change anything?     Rodriguez  Hunter  ascribed  the  authoritarian  habits  of  Argentinean  companies  to  the  country\u2019s  political culture.  Remember that we came from decades of military governments.  Everything was  done  by  hierarchy.   People  were  told what  to  do and  any  deviation  was  not tolerated.    It  was  an  extremely difficult ordeal, Rodriguez Hunter said, to get people who had been doing something in  the same way for decades to accept any sort of change.    I  arrived  at  the  company  in  the  middle  of  all  the  changes  and  it  was  very  hard  for  me,  Rodriguez  Hunter  said.    Most  of  the  people  already  working  in  the  company  did  not  share  Antonio\u2019s  vision.    Long-time  employees  thought  Mosquera\u2019s  plans  were  a  fad,  he  said,  and  displayed an attitude common among Argentineans: Let\u2019s say what this guy wants to hear, but in  practice change almost nothing.  In a few years, he\u2019ll change or be gone, and everything will be the  same.   What  helped  make  the  changes  take  hold, he  asserted, were  the  new  people,  who  clearly  supported Antonio\u2019s vision.  They accelerated the process.   Prior to Mosquera\u2019s arrival, the sales department at MSD operated in much the same fashion as  the rest of the pharmaceutical industry.  A sales rep would plan with his district manager to visit a  set number of physicians in a given month.  He would record each visit on a form and periodically  turn over the completed cards to his manager.  For knocking on the required number of doors, he  received a salary.     Rodriguez Hunter\u2019s primary duty was to professionalize the sales force and transform the way the  sales department worked.  All sales reps received instruction in computers, which none of them had  used before, and learned the tools of planning and forecasting.  They became managers of their own  territories,  responsible  for  efficiently  implementing  the  marketing  plan  and  developing  their  own  business  plans  to  grow  the  area.    Now that  marketing  was integrated  into the  business  units,  they  made decisions about product promotions and the distribution of samples.  Most importantly, no one  filled  out  cards  anymore  after  visiting  a  customer.    Sales  measurements  now  consisted  of  regular  audits  that  kept  track  of  actual  sales  data,  and  Mosquera  created  an  incentive-based  compensation  system using those figures with bonuses for those exceeding their quotas.     To assist in his hiring of new sales reps, Rodriguez Hunter developed with Mosquera a candidate  profile.    Preference  would  be  given  to  college  graduates,  preferably  with  degrees  in  marketing  or  business  administration,  who  had  knowledge  of  a  second  language,  preferably  English,  and  who  were familiar with computers.  Like other leading pharmaceutical companies, Mosquera avoided the  union\u2019s stranglehold over the pool of potential candidates by using the non-unionized sales force of  Buenos Aires City as the vehicle for bringing in new blood.  After receiving the two years\u2019 training  required by law, the new sales reps could then be transferred to other parts of the country and the  union would have to accept them as qualified members.   While Merck products enjoyed a solid reputation for quality among physicians, MSD\u2019s business  had deteriorated, according to Rodriguez Hunter, due to poor management.  Sales reps, for instance,  had ceased to visit physicians in less populated provinces far away from Buenos Aires.  Rodriguez  Hunter reversed the slide by expanding the size and scope of the market.  Efforts were made to visit  all  physicians  in  the  country.    Many  doctors  who  had  lost  contact  with  MSD,  Rodriguez  Hunter  claimed,  were  very  surprised  to  see  a  Merck  representative  again.    An  important  part  of  the  program  was  to  work  more  closely  with  physicians  to  understand  their  needs  and  to  develop  educational projects they would find helpful.  Moreover, the sales force swung away from its single   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  9   398-033   Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   focus  on  sales  to  physicians  and  instead  broadened  its  horizon  to  include  hospitals,  clinics,  pharmacies, and health care organizations.  A toll-free telephone number open 24 hours a day was  established to provide up-to-date information about Merck products.   Six months after he joined the company, the situation looked a little brighter.  The kingdoms that  once dominated the organization were disappearing.  Disgruntled employees who did not want to  participate  in  the  new  plan  were  either  fired  or  quit,  and  Rodriguez  Hunter  said  the  new  and  remaining  workers  lent  a  sense  of  vitality  in  the  restructured  company.    Though  competitors  thought we were nuts for doing away with the old hierarchy, the flattened structure had speeded up  decision-making and provided much better communications for all employees.     Nevertheless,  the  challenge  of  competing  against  the  local  companies  was  daunting.    Lacking  research  and  development  expenses,  the  national  companies,  with  roughly  53%  of  the  market,  enjoyed a huge cost advantage.  Their products included pirated copies of Merck drugs, which were  in  some  cases  priced  30%-50%  lower  than  MSD\u2019s.    For  every  MSD  sales  rep  the  local  companies  sometimes  had  three,  and  attracting  reps  was  difficult  for  MSD  because  of  short-term  salary  differences  and  the  scarcity  of  candidates  fitting  the  desired  profile.    One  MSD  rep  sized-up  the  situation very succinctly, Everything in the environment was against us.       Decision Two  days  before  the  meeting  in  Mosquera\u2019s  office,  the  same  middle  manager  who  had called Ring also alerted Rodriguez Hunter to the presence of the well-connected candidate in the  young professionals program.  Rodriguez Hunter said his first reaction was to make sure the person  was accepted into the program.  He discussed the matter with Ring on Thursday and told her that  the  candidate  should  be  picked  as  one  of  the  interns.    As  the  sales  director,  he  viewed  it  as  an  invaluable opportunity for increasing revenues and market share.   Health care in Argentina, according to Rodriguez Hunter, was provided through a system of  approximately 100 health organizations.  A formulary was a list of drugs approved for coverage by  the  various  insurance  programs  and  for  which  customers  paid  only  about  30%  of  the  cost.    The  largest health care provider in Argentina was the government\u2019s program, which covered 4.2 million  retirees  and  pensioners,  roughly  13%  of  the  country\u2019s  population.    Moreover,  a  large  number  of  Merck\u2019s  products  addressed  health  problems  that  afflicted  older  people,  so  being  included  in  the  government\u2019s formulary was an especially lucrative proposition.  Rodriguez Hunter estimated that it  would add perhaps $5 million annually to MSD\u2019s revenues.   After Quinteiro finished, Rodriguez Hunter was asked for his opinion.  Looking at the matter  from a sales perspective, he replied that he wanted the applicant in the company.  I know, he told  the group, that if this guy is allowed into the company we will have a very good opportunity to get  our products into the government formulary and increase sales by $5 million a year.  So what if he is  in place 16 instead of place 15?  We can change that.  What harm can it do?   Manager of Training and Development   For  two  days  following  the  first  phone  call  about  the  influential  candidate  in  the  young  professionals  program,  Ring  felt  herself  under  mounting  pressure.    She  knew  the  caller  had  subsequently contacted Rodriguez Hunter in an attempt to go over her head, since Rodriguez Hunter  had met with her the next day to plead the case for admitting the candidate.  He received the same  reply,  however;  Ring  simply  told  him  the  outcome  of  the  rankings.    Ring  was  furious  with  the  pressure suddenly thrust upon her.    10   This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE MANAGE (06498) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023.  Merck Sharp & Dohme Argentina, Inc. (A)   398-033   Ring  had  begun  work  at  MSD  in  early  1986  as  a  secretary.    She  had  a  teaching  certificate  and  taught  in  public  schools  for  a  while.    Schoolteachers  were  poorly  paid,  however,  so  she  left  the  profession for a job at MSD.  Over the years she had worked as a secretary in various departments,  and  then  served  the  last  few  years  as  a  supervisor  of  human  resources.    There  were  no  women  managers  at  the  company  until  Mosquera  became  the  managing  director.    A  month  into  his  new  position, Mosquera met with Ring, explained his plans for the company, and promoted her to project  leader for training and development.     Ring  was  stunned  with  the  sudden  development  and  saw  right  away  that  Mosquera  meant  to  change the company in a big way.  You have to understand the radical nature of what Antonio did,  she  explained.    Now  I  was  seated  in  management  meetings  as  an  equal  next  to  the  man  I  had  worked for as a secretary.  For Mosquera\u2019s part, it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.  Putting women in these  positions was nothing special to me, he said.  The issue is whether you are a professional or not\u2014 not whether you are black or white, male or female.  As Ring noted, Mosquera was used to working  in a mixed-gender environment.  When he left Spain a few years earlier, 43% of the Merck sales force  was female, albeit after a four-year push that he helped spearhead.     The  first  year  Ring  was  amazed  at  Mosquera\u2019s  determination  to  implement  change  against  stiff  resistance from an entrenched management, a group she referred to as an old boys club.  Under the  old system, people were responsible only for their immediate task.  Employees looked after their own  small territory and followed the rigidly authoritarian rules of the company, which were always black  and white, never gray.  She enthusiastically welcomed Mosquera\u2019s vision of the company.     Yet even for Ring, adapting took time.  When Mosquera first asked for her ideas on how to change  the human resources function, she recalled her reluctance to speak out.  In the past, employees left  their brains at home and didn\u2019t have options, Ring explained.  They were always told what to do,  how to proceed.  I wanted him to tell me what to do, but he wouldn\u2019t do that.  Instead, he tried to  help me, to coach me to think of good ideas.     In her new position, she worked closely with Quinteiro and Mosquera making plans to change the  culture  and  mentality  of  the  workforce.    With  the  efforts  of  an  outside  consultant,  she  supervised  administering both the 360-degree instrument and the performance appraisal process.  Whatever the  human  resources  director  decided  in  the  past,  well,  that  was  how  it  went,  Ring  said.    Now,  everyone was involved in their own performance appraisal.     In  January  1996,  she  began  the  training  sessions  aimed  at  coaching  employees  in  areas  such  as  leadership,  communication,  conducting  meetings,  teamwork,  planning,  forecasting,  and  resource  allocation.    After  the  360,  she  said,  everyone  was  more  informed  about  what  was  expected  of  them.    As  the  sessions  progressed,  she  felt  that  more  employees  were  making  a  personal  commitment to the change process.  What really made the difference, though, were not the sessions  but the changes people saw around them.   Decision  When Ring entered Mosquera\u2019s office for the meeting, she really was not sure how the  issue should be decided.  She and two assistants had analyzed the thirty candidates during the two- week  evaluation  process.    Through  a  series  of  trials,  candidates  were  put  in  a  work-like  sales  environment and  judged  on  various  factors,  including  such  matters  as attitude,  which  was seen as  critical  to  people\u2019s  ability  to  work  in  teams.    The  candidate  with  government  connections  was  actually very good and had scored only slightly less than the person in fifteenth place.  Ring listened  to Quinteiro\u2019s opposition, and then heard Rodriguez Hunter make his case.  Her turn was next.
