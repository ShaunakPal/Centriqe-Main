      " Hey, who are you? This will help series. I'm going to talk a little bit about how you would get your own images into a scene in Unreal. So this folks asked about specifically graffiti, so how it would bring in my image in and display it if I was building some content in Unreal Engine. So today we're going to talk about that and we're going to use decals in Unreal to be able to do that. And so let's set the scene here. So I'm in an awesome bar scene that I got from the Unreal Marketplace. It's super cool. I'm kind of actually doing a little more with the lighting here to kind of light it up. As you can see, you've got a couple of coolagins here in the bar and they're animated, doing some cool stuff. I'm going to be working on this for a little while. What I want to show today is we have a nice brick wall over here. So take a look at this brick wall. And so what I'm going to show you is how to take and put an image on that wall. Now you can create pictures and frames and stuff. In this case, I'm going to drop some graffiti in there because Pat some folks wanted to sort of customize what they're doing using their own specific graffiti images. So again, we're going to in a scene here, I've got one of the environment assets I downloaded from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. And we're going to go ahead and put a nice graffiti image on the wall here. The first thing I want to do is get our graffiti image into Unreal. So what I've done is I've simply created a materials folder, graffiti folder. And what we're going to do is very simply, I actually have this graffiti for the cipher buns. And so all this is, is a PNG file that's got a transparent background. So it's important to have a transparent background if you want to lay it up against the textures of whatever wall or floor or thing that you want to put it on there. So again, this is a simple PNG file that has a transparent background. And I'm just going to drag it into Unreal. So you should be familiar with me in bringing in your content drawer. You can see kind of looks smeared. We'll talk about that in a second. It's really a texture file. It's a PNG file in Unreal. We'll translate that in as you drag it in. And the first thing you can do is this is a texture. The PNG file, the texture. Right click and do create material. And what that'll do is it'll create a material is what you, we're going to need a material to apply it to the actor or the decal actor that we put into Unreal. So if you just right click and do create material, it'll create a material out of the image that you just brought in. And double click on that material. We're going to clean this up a little bit. We're going to make it so that we're able to take this material and put it on something. And remember, this is what is a transparent background PNG that we brought in. So the first thing we'll do is over here on the left where it says material. You have material domain. And set up surface, we're going to make this a deferred decal. And the first thing we're going to do is, oh, actually take that back, let's leave the surface there and let's first drag the RGB over to the base color. And we're going to make it a deferred decal. And the other thing we're going to do is we're going to change the blend mode to translucent. And this is because it's a background or it's a translucent or transparent background image. And we're going to take our A and put it to opacity. What I'll do is I'll create, it'll make the transparency through the opacity in the material using the texture that you have brought in. And so I'm not going to go into great detail there. The simple part of this is you brought your PNG file in. You created a material out of it. We mapped the RGB colors to the base color of this new material. We call it cipher buns mat for material. Change the blend mode to translucent and connect your A texture sample to the opacity. So now what you have and click save, now what you have is a material with a translucent background. Now you kind of see over here on the left, it's kind of hard to picture. But what we're going to do is we take this material and we're going to put it on a decal. It's an object where it's an actor that we're going to put in our scene. So you're back in here, you've created your material out of your PNG image. Now up on the left here you want to add a basic actor, I'm sorry, a visual effects actor and it's called a decal actor. So I added that decal actor and you see over here on my outline or it created a decal actor. So I don't think it's real quick, the actors in the scene now, I'm going to call this hooly cipher underscore decal. So I know what this is. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to move this, I credit a forward to kind of keep this simple called holy graffiti decals. So we're moving into that folder and I'm doing that just so I can court it. I have a couple other decals. This is the holy girl one that I showed you before. Now I have a hooly cipher decal. Now I want to double click on this decal. Now you see it's kind of out there and it doesn't really have material. I'm going to show you a secret a quick way to kind of bring it to where you want it. But for now what we want to do is open up that decal and we want to assign, see this decal material here. And again, don't worry where it is in the world. I'm going to show you really quickly how to snap that to where you want it to be. But we've got the decal, we've got this default or decal material. We want to do is we want to drag and assign this new cipher material as the material for our decal. So I got my cipher material and I'm going to drag it right here. And so that's going to be the decal material for the decal created is my new cipher bun. Okay. So let's save that. Now I'm going to show you a quick trick. Leave your decal kind of out there. So this is the wall we want to put it on. We put it right over here next to the dartboard. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to click on the dartboard. And if I click on the dartboard and I go to the general and I look for location, what am I going to do is I'm going to right click on that and do copy. What you're doing is you're copying the location of the dartboard and I'm going to go ahead and then and snap my decal to the same location. The reason that is, this is kind of a easy way for you to just bring that instance or that actor right to the place you want. And then we'll use the XYZ access to sort of alter it. But right click on the location of my dartboard and then I go back up and I open up my cipher decal. Alright, double click on it and go to the location and do paste. What it'll do is it'll take it into, it'll take it back into the location of, there it is right inside there. It'll take it inside the, in my case it's inside the bar. Basically, you know, it's just, in my case it was a dartboard. In your case it might be something else. And point is, you want to create your, you want to create your decal and then you want to either you can drag it or right click a location of somewhere or a wall that you want to put it on. So hopefully that makes sense. I feel like I'm getting a little confusing on here but I think you get the point. So the good is is now here we go. So it's in the same location as the dartboard. Well, now in this case, no worries. We're going to use the typical tools we have. So first let's do some quick, you know, tweak it in this. So let's turn it around. Now the problem is, is it backwards, no problem. Let's flip around 180. And 180 is pretty there. Let's grab this and move it over a little bit. It'll start to look a little bit better. Yeah, it's going to kind of cool. So it gets the wall. Now we'll take our alter or our shapesizing tool. Let's make it a little bit smaller. And there. Move it over. You get the jess. It's kind of coming into shape. Now, one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and copy a light. Because if we bring a light over here with a better chance, now I just started to see it a little better. Let's bring it down and light it up a little bit. Maybe I'll go and take this light source and I'll change the intensity from 20 to like 10 so it's not so incredibly incredibly bright there. There it is. Yeah, so basically now if you take a look, we have our image, our, let's go up. Remember, I put it in the folder here. I'm going to grab that decal. We have a decal in our scene, our cipher decal. And it is made of the material, the PNG file that we brought in. And we've moved it around. Let's go ahead and like I said, maybe we'll shape it a little bit more here. I'll zoom in. Cipher bomb. There we go. Let's start to look kind of cool. Let's maybe move our light a little bit. The lights just deal for a little bit of a fact. You don't have to do that. I just kind of thought it would be cool to be able to kind of see it a little bit. You can change a little bit like 70 intensity and how that light shining over there. But there you go. You now have to be perspective. We'll do the cinematic view. So that's some way for you to bring in a PNG file. So I'm dragging in. Create material out of it. Change the material, Translucency and make sure that you map the opacity. And then once you do that, you can go ahead and add an in-game object called a decal. And you can move that decal. So it's an individual effects decal actor. And you can go ahead and make the default or the detailed decal material, your material. And you can, you know, this is kind of cool. Like see how it kind of blends right in and sort of snaps to the wall. In this case, this cool brick wall. I kind of thought this is a good way to look at it. So hopefully that helps. And I'll catch you on the next one. Have a great day.\n"
